Features:

User ID

Movie ID

Genre

Number of reviews (or votes)

Target Variable:

Movie Rating

The dataset contains rating movies.
Approach

1. Load the movie rating dataset

2. Perform data cleaning and preprocessing

3. Convert categorical data into numerical form

4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets

5. Train a regression model

6. Predict movie ratings

7. Evaluate the model performance
