Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction
The goal of this project is to build a Data Sceince model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on passenger details.

Dataset
The dataset contains passenger information such as:

 .Passenger class
.Age
.Gender
.Fare
.Number of family members onboard
.File used

.train.csv
.titanic.py

Approach

1.Loaded and explored the dataset
2.Cleaned missing and inconsistent data
3.Converted categorical values into numerical format
4.Split data into training and testing sets
4.Trained a data science classification model
5.Evaluated model performance

Technologies Used
.Python
.Pandas
.NumPy
.Scikit-learn

How to Run the Project

python titanic.py
