three species - Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica - based on their sepal and petal measurements using a machine learning classification algorithm.

Dataset

The project uses the Iris Dataset, a well-known dataset in machine learning.

Features:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

Target Variable:

Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

The dataset contains 150 samples, with 50 samples for each class.
Approach

1. Load the Iris dataset

2. Preprocess the data (separate features and labels)

3. Split the data into training and testing sets

4. Train a classification model

5. Predict the flower species

6. Evaluate the model accuracy

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)
